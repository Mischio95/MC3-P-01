# MC3-P-01

Platform game developed with the SpriteKit framework.

The game tells the story of a small robot, p-01. Whose name is formed of P derived from phos, from the Greek word meaning light, and 01 which is its serial number. P-01 is a robot intended to keep human children company but was quickly replaced by other robots with more functionality and, having become obsolete, was thrown away.
He will prove to be the key to save the world above, afflicted by a fearsome computer virus, that infected all the robots of a generation superior to his.
His journey begins in the sewer , surrounded by the dark, various wreck and mutated monsters.
Will you be able to help him reach the surface?
